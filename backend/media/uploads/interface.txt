what are illegal combinations of other modifier with an abstract modifier in abstract methods in java

In Java, there are certain rules and restrictions regarding the use of modifiers in abstract methods. When combining modifiers in abstract methods, the following combinations are illegal:

    Final and abstract: The "final" modifier indicates that a method cannot be overridden, while the "abstract" modifier indicates that a method must be overridden. These modifiers have conflicting meanings and cannot be used together.

    Private and abstract: The "private" modifier restricts the visibility of a method to within the same class, whereas the "abstract" modifier requires the method to be implemented in a subclass. Since a private method cannot be accessed or overridden by subclasses, combining "private" and "abstract" modifiers is not allowed.

    Static and abstract: The "static" modifier is used to create a method that belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. On the other hand, the "abstract" modifier is intended for methods that must be implemented in a subclass. Combining "static" and "abstract" modifiers is contradictory because static methods cannot be overridden.

    Abstract and final: The "abstract" modifier indicates that a method must be overridden, while the "final" modifier indicates that a method cannot be overridden. These modifiers have conflicting meanings and cannot be used together.

It's important to note that abstract methods must be declared within abstract classes or interfaces, and they do not have a method body. Subclasses or implementing classes are responsible for providing the implementation for these abstract methods.

Here's an example of a legal abstract method declaration:
java

public abstract class AbstractClass {
    public abstract void abstractMethod();
}

In the above example, the method "abstractMethod" is declared as abstract, indicating that any subclass of "AbstractClass" must provide an implementation for this method.

what methods or variables cannot be overridden in java

In Java, there are certain methods and variables that cannot be overridden. These include:

    Final methods: Methods declared as "final" in a superclass cannot be overridden in any subclass. The "final" modifier indicates that the method implementation is complete and cannot be changed.

    Static methods: Static methods belong to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. They cannot be overridden because they are resolved at compile-time based on the class in which they are defined. Subclasses can declare methods with the same name, but this is known as "method hiding" rather than overriding.

    Private methods: Private methods are not accessible outside the class in which they are declared. Since they are not visible to subclasses, they cannot be overridden.

    Constructors: Constructors are special methods used for object initialization. They cannot be overridden because they are specific to the class in which they are defined. However, a subclass can call the constructor of its superclass using the "super" keyword.

    Final variables: Variables declared as "final" cannot be modified once assigned a value. They are constants and cannot be overridden in subclasses.

It's important to note that the above restrictions apply to methods and variables within classes. Interfaces, on the other hand, define contracts that can be implemented and overridden by classes. Additionally, classes declared as "final" cannot be subclassed, so no methods or variables within them can be overridden.

In Java, interfaces are used to define a contract that classes can implement. All methods declared within an interface are implicitly abstract, meaning they do not have a method body. By default, methods in interfaces are also public and abstract, even if those modifiers are not explicitly specified.

Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also contain static methods. Static methods in interfaces are used to provide utility methods or helper functions that are not tied to any specific instance of a class. These methods can be called directly on the interface itself, without the need for an implementing class. To define a static method in an interface, the "static" keyword is used, and the method must have a method body.

Here's an example of an interface in Java:
java

public interface MyInterface {
    int MAX_VALUE = 100; // Constant variable (implicitly public, static, and final)

    void abstractMethod(); // Abstract method (implicitly public and abstract)

    default void defaultMethod() {
        // Default method with a method body (available from Java 8 onwards)
        System.out.println("Default method implementation");
    }

    static void staticMethod() {
        // Static method with a method body (available from Java 8 onwards)
        System.out.println("Static method implementation");
    }
}

In the above example, the interface "MyInterface" contains an abstract method called "abstractMethod" and a default method called "defaultMethod". It also defines a constant variable "MAX_VALUE" and a static method called "staticMethod".

Classes that implement the interface must provide an implementation for the abstract method "abstractMethod". They can also override the default method if needed. The constant variable "MAX_VALUE" can be accessed directly using the interface name, such as MyInterface.MAX_VALUE. The static method "staticMethod" can be called using the interface name as well, such as MyInterface.staticMethod().

interface can contain static methods and default methods, and all methods in interface are abstract by default, are static methods and default methods in an interface abstract?

Yes, interfaces in Java can contain static methods and default methods. However, it's important to note that not all methods in an interface are abstract, despite the fact that all methods in an interface are implicitly abstract.

Let's examine the nature of static methods and default methods in interfaces:

    Static methods: Static methods in interfaces are not abstract. They have a method body and provide a concrete implementation. They are not required to be overridden by implementing classes, as they can be called directly on the interface itself. Static methods in interfaces are intended to provide utility methods or helper functions that are related to the interface's functionality.

    Default methods: Default methods in interfaces are also not abstract. They have a method body and provide a default implementation. They are designed to offer a default behavior that implementing classes can use. If a class implementing the interface does not override the default method, it will inherit and use the default implementation provided in the interface. Implementing classes have the option to override default methods if they wish to provide their own implementation.

In summary, while all methods in an interface are implicitly abstract, static methods and default methods in interfaces are not considered abstract. They provide concrete implementations and serve different purposes in the context of interfaces.
